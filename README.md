jQuery Fortune Teller Program

This is my first jQuery program. 

The program prompts the user for a question. 

The question that is submitted is then made into an array that is searched for certain keywords such as "love" or "money".

Based on the keyword, one of ten random answers is returned to the user.

---Things I would like to do for future revisions as of May 31, 2013----

- add styling to page.

- create an animated version with HTML5 and CSS3

- Use program and create different versions for different uses.
